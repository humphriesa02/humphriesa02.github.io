                    Hi, my name is Hero, and I run Hero's Code. This is a self motivated Game Development dream I have, which is to one day
                    make a full fledge game you can see on, say, Steam. I started this journey around the beginning of May of 2021, so I
                    definitely have a lot to learn. This also means that you'll have to forgive
                    some of my amateur mistakes, I'm still learning. Join me as I talk video games and their development, give updates on my projects,
                    show off other code related things, and all around (hopefully) create a portfolio I can one day be truly proud of. If you like what I do
                    make sure you play my games and give some feedback! Thanks!
                </p>
